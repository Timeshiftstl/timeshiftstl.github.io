    <p>
      Time shift clock is an app to help you get to places on time. We believe that time is perceived and used differently by people. Taking this into account, we strive to build an app that adjusts to your lifestyle. Say you dont like 9s or 5s. We can take those out for you! Need ten minutes before hand to start driving somewhere. Got you covered there as well. Now you might be saying well thats great and all but where's the app? Well it's currently in beta. This app however is in fairly usable form. If you would like to try the beta. You can apply for the beta program and added to our mailing list. Just apply by clicking this link.<a href = "http://goo.gl/forms/hOHJYNfywh">http://goo.gl/forms/hOHJYNfywh</a> NOTE: Time shift clock is currently only for Android at the moment. We'll provide more info when we come up with a company name.
